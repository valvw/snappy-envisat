# Configuring Python to use SNAP-Python (snappy) Interface
The SNAP-Python (snappy) interface allows you to access the functionality of the SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) toolbox in Python. Here's how you can configure Python to use the snappy interface:

## Step 1: Install SNAP Toolbox
Download and install the SNAP toolbox from the official SNAP website (https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/).
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to install SNAP on your machine.

## Step 2: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle Java website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html).
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system to install JDK.

## Step 3: Install Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (Windows only)
Download and install Visual Studio C++ Build Tools from the official Microsoft website (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
Follow the installation instructions for Visual Studio C++ Build Tools. Make sure to install version 14 or greater.

## Step 3: Download Maven Zip File and Extract
Open a web browser and go to the official Apache Maven website: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
Click on the appropriate link to download the binary zip archive of the latest version of Maven (e.g., "apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.zip").
Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded zip file and extract its contents to a directory of your choice (e.g., C:\user\maven).
Set the MAVEN_HOME environment variable to the directory where Maven is extracted. Replace <maven-dir> with the actual path to the Maven directory:
Open a command prompt as an administrator. Run the following command:
```
setx MAVEN_HOME "<MavenDir>"
```
Add Maven to the system's PATH environment variable:
```
;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin
```
Verify the Maven installation by opening a new command prompt or terminal window and running the following command:
```
mvn -v
```

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables
Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Set the `VS100COMNTOOLS` environment variable to the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools directory. Replace `<Visual-Studio-Dir>` with the actual path to your Visual Studio C++ Build Tools installation:
```
SET VS100COMNTOOLS=<Visual-Studio-Dir>\Common7\Tools\
```
Set the `JDK_HOME` environment variable to the JDK installation directory. Replace `<jdk-dir>` with the actual path to your JDK installation:
```
SET JDK_HOME=<jdk-dir>
```


## Step 5: Clone jpy Repository
Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the jpy repository
```
cd C:\user\.snap\snap-python\snappy
```
Clone the jpy repository by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/bcdev/jpy.git
```

## Step 6: Build and Install jpy
Navigate to the jpy directory:
```
cd C:\user\.snap\snap-python\snappy\jpy
```
Build the jpy package by running the following command:
```
SET VS100COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\
SET JDK_HOME=<your-jdk-dir>
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
Copy the generated .whl file from the jpy/dist directory to the C:\user\.snap\snap-python\snappy directory.

## Step 6: Install snappy Python Package
Navigate to the snappy directory.
Install the snappy package by running the following command:
```
python setup.py install
```
Install the jpy package by running the following command:
```
pip install <.whl file>
```

## Step 7: Configure snappy Python Package
Navigate to the C:\Program Files\snap\bin directory.
Run the snappy-conf.bat script with the path to the Python executable of Anaconda 3. For example:
```
snappy-conf.bat C:\path\to\Anaconda3\python.exe
```
Copy the files from the C:\user\.snap\snap-python\snappy directory to C:\..\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\snappy directory.
